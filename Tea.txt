Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis,
an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar.
Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of Camellia taliensis.
